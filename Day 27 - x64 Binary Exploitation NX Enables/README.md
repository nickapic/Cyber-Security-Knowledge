NX Protection means : Not Executable stack which means anything in the stack wont be executable for us and we would have to use the stuff inside the binary or being used by the binary to succeced in our objective.
In NX basically the stack address does not have executable permissions to see it if you run the binary and do vmmap you can see the perms on the stack and it would say rw- making it NX enabled and not executable so any shellcode put in the stack wont be executed/excetuable.

Options to bypass this : Dont use stack for execution or stack executable again and execute your shellcode then.

First and most common one is RET2LIBC which is a library that is used by binaries written in C to execute stuff and we can point to an address in here. Ideally if there is a system function used it calls in libc and ideally the first arguement gets into RDI regsiter and in general first 6 arguements are placed in registers and if there are more then 6 arguements then they are placed on the stack. You can check which registers your arguement is in by doing 
```bash
info registers
```
