# Cyber Security Knowledge
 A Project where i try to learn something new every 2 days, 1 day for learning and the next day for applying the knowledge and this is a place to track it.



The Idea is to learn a new thing and then apply it, by Investing on Day 1 some time to research about the subject and then on Day 2 apply that knowledge onto a platform so for example doing a HTB Challenge, or do a Port Swigger Academy lab etc.
