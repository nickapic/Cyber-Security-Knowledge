# Cyber Security Knowledge
 A Project where i try to learn something new every 2 days, 1 day for learning and the next day for applying the knowledge and this is a place to track it.

The Idea is to learn a new thing and then apply it, by Investing on Day 1 some time to research about the subject and then on Day 2 apply that knowledge onto a platform so for example doing a HTB Challenge, or do a Port Swigger Academy lab etc.

This challenge was inspired from a challenge I found on LinkedIn : https://github.com/harsh-bothra/learn365
Day 1 : Basic of Linux Stack Smashing/ Buffer Overflows / Intro to GDB
Day 2 : Practice on HTB and a Challenge from Tenable CTF
Day 3: Basic AD Enumeration via Power View and using The AD Module 
Day 4 : Privilege Escalation on a basic Level in AD environments
