There are two types of Apps : Native and Hybrid Apps.

Native : Made for Mobile OS specifically, Android uses Java or Kotlin and IOS uses Swift or Objective-C.

Hybrid : These are made using Hybrid Frameworks like Flutter, React Native and so on.

As we are talking about mainly android hacking here if you create a android apk file it contain a .dex file, which contains binary Dalvik bytecode, and this contain Smali which is an assembly language that runs on Dalvik VM.

Smali Types :
v : void
z : boolean
B : byte
S : short
C : char
F : float
I : int
J : long
D : double
[ : array

Smali Registers byÂ JesusFreke :

In dalvik's bytecode, registers are always 32 bits, and can hold any type of value. 2 registers are used to hold 64 bit types (Long and Double).

Two ways to spefiy how many registers are available in a method, .registers directive specifies the total number of registers in the method. and .locals directive specifies the number of non-parameter registers in the method.

When a method i called the parameters are place on the last n registers, for ex. if 2 arguements are passed and it has 5 registers (v0 - v4) the params would be placed in v3,v4.

Lets try to find a tool to first help us emulate stuff as well with android apps its a good call to find an appliation to emulate those apps on our computer.
